## Features

### **Core Functionalities**
1. **Product Management**
   - Full CRUD operations for products.
   - Manage attributes such as:
     - Prices (original and discounted).
     - Preparation time (e.g., for food items).

   - Image upload support with Laravel's storage system.
   - Filter and search options for streamlined product discovery.

2. **Category Management**
   - CRUD operations for categories.
   - Advanced sorting powered by **Sortify.js** for drag-and-drop reordering.
   - Toggle `enabled` and `featured` statuses for each category.
   - Categories linked to products with soft delete functionality.

   - **Responsive Design:** Built with **TailwindCSS** and **DaisyUI** to provide a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile.

### **Authentication and Security**
- **Authentication Middleware:** Restricts access to admin routes to logged-in users.
- **Security Practices:** Admin panel is accessible only through `/admin` to reduce exposure.

### **Frontend and Backend Integrations**
- Frontend powered by Blade templates with reusable components.
- Backend APIs utilize AJAX for real-time updates.

## Project Structure

### **Routes**
The routes are defined in `web.php` and follow a clear hierarchy:
- `/`: User-facing homepage displaying categorized and uncategorized products.
- `/about`: Static page for informational content.
- `/admin`: Admin dashboard (authentication required).

#### **Admin Routes**
Admin-specific routes are grouped under the `admin` prefix and middleware for enhanced organization:
- **Settings Management:**
  - `/admin/settings` (GET/POST)
- **Categories Management:**
  - `/admin/categories` (CRUD with sortable features)
- **Products Management:**
  - `/admin/products` (CRUD with image management)

### **Database Schema**
1. **Categories Table**
   - Stores category details and supports sorting and soft deletes.
   - Key fields:
     - `id`, `name`, `description`, `enabled`, `featured`, `sort`.

2. **Products Table**
   - Stores product details with foreign key linking to categories.
   - Key fields:
     - `id`, `name`, `price`, `new_price`, `preparation_time`, `image_url`, `category_id`.

3. **Settings Table**
   - Stores global application settings in a key-value pair format.

### **Controllers**
1. **CategoryController**
   - Handles CRUD operations for categories.
   - Provides APIs for sorting, enabling/disabling, and toggling featured status.
2. **ProductController**
   - Manages products, including image uploads, CRUD operations, and toggling features.
3. **SettingsController**
   - Updates and stores global application settings.
4. **HomeController**
   - Manages user-facing pages and admin dashboard metrics.

## Customization

### **Themes and Design**
- Built using **TailwindCSS** and **DaisyUI** for effortless customization.
- Toggle between dark and light modes directly from the admin interface.

### **Sorting Categories**
- The sortable feature is implemented using **Sortify.js** for a drag-and-drop interface.

### **Dynamic Settings**
- Admin can control visibility and layout of elements on the frontend (e.g., product descriptions, calorie counts).

---

## Development Notes

### **AJAX Features**
- Category and product toggles use AJAX for real-time updates.
- Sorting operations send asynchronous requests to persist changes.

### **Seeder for Default Settings**
The application ships with a seeder (`SettingsSeeder`) to pre-populate default configurations.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
